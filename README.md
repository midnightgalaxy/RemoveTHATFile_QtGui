# RemoveTHATFile_QtGui

A simple Qt gui application which purpose is to remove ALL the files with a certain file name from the entered path.

I created this application because I wanted to remove all the "thumbs.db"-files from a certain location. For those of you who don't know about "thumbs-db"-files -> it's a file the Windows operatingsystem created for faster preview of thumbnails. Very annoying in my meaning! So that is a perfect usage for this program. 

Thank you! :)
